\begin{abstract}
The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should
contain at least 70 and at most 150 words. It should be written using the
\emph{abstract} environment.
\keywords{We would like to encourage you to list your keywords within
the abstract section}
\end{abstract}
}


\section{Background Updates} 

State your challenge, and summarize any new literature, data set and images/video you have encountered since the progress report.  (2 min / 2 pages)

\section{Data Matrices}

Report on the size (number of rows) and composition (descriptions of the columns) of the data matrices you have assembled to build your models from.  Where did the data come from, and how satisfied are you with what you have for your project? (3 minutes / 3 pages)


\section{Development/Evaluation Environment}

Report on the block structure of your development/evaluation environment, with what statistics you are reporting to demonstrate the performance of your various model.  Show screenshots/output traces so we can see what you are getting from your environment. (5 minutes / 2-3 pages)


\section{Current Model and Baseline}

describe your current (presumably machine learning-based) model, and present results from your evaluation environment showing the performance of it against your baseline models. What methods of fitting/data analysis are you using? (5 minutes, 3-5 pages)


\section{Current Prediction and Next Steps}

State your current forecast for your challenge. Present what you will do next to get a complete predictive model.  Discuss any difficulties you will have to overcome in building a good model   (4 min / 2-3 pages)
